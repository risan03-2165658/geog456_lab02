# Narrative: Exploring the Majesty of Mount Fuji, Mount Everest, and Mount Rainier

## Topic Description and Search Parameters:

Mount Fuji, Mount Everest, and Mount Rainier are renowned peaks, each with distinct importance in culture, geography, and mountaineering. To explore their essence, I conducted a thorough search using YouTube (developed a Youtube crawler using Selenium) and Wordart to gather comprehensive insights.

## Reason for Comparison:

The desire to compare these three majestic peaks arises from their global recognition and diverse characteristics. Mount Fuji represents Japan's cultural and natural heritage, Mount Everest stands as the world's highest peak, while Mount Rainier epitomizes the beauty and challenges of the Pacific Northwest in the United States. By juxtaposing these mountains, I aimed to uncover the nuances of their significance, geographical features, and cultural representations.

## Comparison of Word Clouds:

Looking at the word clouds for Mount Fuji, Mount Everest, and Mount Rainier gives us interesting insights into what they represent. For "Mount Fuji," words like "climb," "Japan," "Sushi," and "Lofi", showing its cultural and spiritual significance. "Mount Rainier" is filled with terms such as "Washington," "hike," "park," and "beauty," underlining its natural allure and environmental importance. Meanwhile, "Mount Everest" features words like "summit," "top," "die," and "dream," highlighting its association with challenging mountaineering adventures and extreme heights. Overall, the most searched terms were "mountain", "Mt", and the name of the mountain which is as expected. 

## Possible Reasons for Patterns Observed:

The observed patterns in the word clouds stem from the distinct features and cultural contexts of each mountain. When examining the word clouds for Mount Fuji, Mount Everest, and Mount Rainier, fascinating insights emerge regarding the varied significance and perceptions associated with these iconic peaks. For Mount Fuji, terms like "climb," "Japan," "Sushi," and "Lofi" highlight its profound cultural and spiritual importance within Japanese society, serving as both a physical landmark and a deeply ingrained symbol in art, literature, and daily life. On the other hand, the word cloud for Mount Rainier emphasizes its natural beauty and recreational appeal, with words such as "Washington," "hike," "park," and "beauty" showcasing its status as a beloved destination for outdoor enthusiasts, offering opportunities for hiking, camping, and wildlife exploration within Mount Rainier National Park.

In contrast, the word cloud for Mount Everest reflects the mountain's formidable reputation as the world's highest peak and the ultimate challenge for adventurers. Terms like "summit," "top," "die," and "dream" underscore the extreme nature of Everest expeditions, portraying it as a beacon for ambitious mountaineers and a symbol of human endurance and perseverance against daunting odds. Overall, these word clouds not only capture the physical attributes of the mountains but also illuminate their cultural, recreational, and aspirational significance, showcasing the diverse ways in which they are perceived, admired, and pursued by people worldwide.

## Improvements for Future Research:

Firstly, we could gather more data, as I believe the current dataset was insufficient to accurately represent the perceptions people have of these mountains. Secondly, incorporating additional social media data and contemporary accounts from climbers and travelers could offer real-time insights into the evolving perceptions and experiences associated with these peaks. Additionally, it would be beneficial to find ways to reduce bias in our decision-making process. While creating the word cloud, I encountered challenges in discerning between common terms and meaningless ones. Consequently, it was difficult to determine whether certain terms were relevant or unrelated. Therefore, implementing clear criteria or alternative methods to minimize bias in decision-making would enhance the validity of future research endeavors.

## Unexpected Findings and Standout Observations:

One unexpected finding is the presence of the term "lofi" associated with Mount Fuji was puzzling at first. However, upon further investigation, I discovered that "lofi" is linked to Japan due to the country's significant role in the world of Lo-Fi music. The genre's connection to Japan's aesthetic values of wabi-sabi, which appreciate imperfection and transience, explains its association with Mount Fuji. Thus, while Mount Rainier represents a mountain in Washington, Mount Fuji symbolizes the entire nation of Japan, reflecting its cultural and spiritual significance beyond being just a physical landmark.
